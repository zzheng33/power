1. a lot work on ee 
2. UPS pionner work : uncore
3. things have been changed, production system: CPU+GPU
4. intel allows dynamic uncore frequency tuning, but, it is still max
by default 
5. our work addresses this problem, user-transparent runtime
6 goal: minimize performance loss, maxmize energy saving
7.approach: memory-throughput based dynamic uncore frequency tuning:
power dynamics(high frequency changes in memory throughput, first derivative)

experiment: max default, UPS
