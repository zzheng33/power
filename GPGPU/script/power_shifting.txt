Idea: 
shift power budge from CPU to GPU, and vice versa, based on their power demands. 


Conditions and Constraints:
1. Each compute node has a fixed power budget. 
2. Assume that CPU and GPU share the fixed power budget evenly across the execution by default. 


Previous research results:
1. Scaling the uncore frequency dynamically can save CPU power while maintain the lower performance loss. 


Goal: 
1. shift the power budget saved by the uncore frequency scaling to GPU to improve the performance. 



Prelinary Experiment Plan:

TDP for 2 sockets: 540 W
TDP for A100-40GB: 250 W

Suppose 60% Power cap for one node. 
2-sockets: 324 W
GPU: 150 W
